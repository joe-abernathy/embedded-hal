# rp2040-hal

This repository aims to develop a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for the RP2040 microcontroller from scratch using Rust. This is primarily intended as a personal learning experience to enhance my embedded programming skills with Rust.

Goals:

- Develop a functional HAL for the RP2040 microcontroller using Rust
- Improve my understanding of low-level programming, embedded systems, and hardware interactions
- Collaborate with the community to learn from experienced developers and receive feedback on my code
- Try to keep from pulling my hair out when this gets too deep

Please Note:
- This project is in its very early stages and may contain bugs, incomplete features, or suboptimal implementation. Any contributions or suggestions are welcome
- My primary goal with this project is personal growth. This codebase may not reflect production-ready quality
- I'm relatively new to Rust, and to the field of embedded programming, so please bear with me as I learn. Feedback and guidance are always welcome!
